# Deneme

This is a basic 2-D strategy game that I sometimes work on for learning Unity concepts. 

As the project was for trying new concepts and developed by me only; it is not clean, consistent or tidy at this point. 

I did not create a gitignore file and basically pushed everything for now. Therefore lots of meta/temp files were pushed.
